### Debouncing

 ex:- typing slow = 200ms
      typing fast = 30ms

performance:
 - iphone pro max = 14 letter * 1000 ppl type at a time= 14000
 - with debouncing = 3 API Calls * 1000 = 3000

debouncing with 200ms
- if difference between 2 key strokes is < 200ms - DECLINE the API call
- > 200ms make an API Call
